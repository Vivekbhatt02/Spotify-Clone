# Spotify Clone 🎶

## Overview:
This project is a Spotify clone that emulates key features of the popular music streaming service. Built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it provides a responsive and fully functional user experience. The aim is to demonstrate how to build a music streaming app with core features and modern web development practices.

## Features:
- 🎵 **Playlists**: Dynamic playlist creation and loading.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout with a hamburger menu for navigation.
- 🎧 **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, skip, and control volume seamlessly.
- 🤖 **Smart Playlist Detection**: Automatically recognizes new playlists when a folder with `info.json` and `cover.jpg` is added in the `songs` directory.
- 👥 **User-Friendly UI**: Intuitive and visually appealing interface.
