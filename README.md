You can modify or add playlists to the app. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Fork the Repo**
   Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Add a Playlist Folder**
   Create a new folder in the `songs` directory. The app will automatically detect it as a new playlist.

3. **Include Playlist Details**
   Add the following files to the new folder:

   - `info.json`: Contains metadata for the playlist.
   - `cover.jpg`: The image used as the playlist thumbnail.

4. **Structure of `info.json`**
